# Overview of project

Utilizing VBA to analyze the transactional volume and performance for 12 stocks from 2017 to 2018.

# Results

2017 was likely a year in which the broader stock market performed well.  Of the 12 stocks tracked, 11 of them had positive performances for the year.  In addition, there were four stocks that had triple digit gains for the year in addition to one particular stock, "DQ" almost hitting a 200% return for the year.  Also, based on what we saw with 2018 results, 2017 was likely the top of the market.

2018 was almost the exact opposite of 2017.  as 10 fo the 12 stocks tracked showed negative performances for the year.  Thus, this was likley when the overall market saw a downturn.  However, there were two stocks, "ENPH" and "RUN" that posted positive results for the year and meant that these two stocks showed two consecutive years of positve performance.

Based on these results, investors in ENPH would have yielded the largest two year returns of the 12 stocks tracked.
